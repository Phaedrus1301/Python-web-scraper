# Python-web-scraper
A small python project to fetch Name, price and model number of a product from ecommerce website.

Please note:
- this code will NOT run as is.
- i have explained how it runs, what changes you have to make to make it run within the code as comments. hope they are readable as english is not my primary language.
- this isn't the most efficient code out there, but it served my specific set of request and hence it worked for me.
- the sephora part is just added for example. you will need to go to your target website, do inspect element and modify the code accordingly and only then try to run it.
- you may need to add lazy loading workaround in this if the target website has it.
- from what i have tested, the speed of script vastly depends on how fast the target website loads and runs and then on the code itself.

I am still a newbie to coding world, so sorry if the code is incorrect in anyway and hope it helped few people.
